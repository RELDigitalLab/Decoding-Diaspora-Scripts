Current Issues:

-Commas in datas cause issues with delimiter
-Multiple pages are created in Scalar with duplicate entries

To-Do:

-Look in JSON formatting for putting multiple metadata tags on one page for the same column
-Looking into ways to provide coordinates for locations
    - Geo Data Viewer
    - GPS Visualizer
    - Open Street Maps
   We are going to have students compile all of the cords for the metadata.
